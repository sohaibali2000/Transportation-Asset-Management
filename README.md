# Transportation-Asset-Management


This project aimed to assess the performance of culverts in Colorado, focusing on how changing precipitation patterns impact their structural integrity. By analyzing 24,000 publicly available records from transportation and climate datasets, the team evaluated key risks such as increased water flow, sediment transport, and scouring, which could compromise culvert stability. Using Power BI, the team created interactive dashboards to visualize these impacts, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for proactive infrastructure maintenance and climate-resilient design strategies.
